# Terminal
My macOS Terminal theme, named "Basic, but sexier".

### Using
Download the file [here](https://github.com/AppleBetas/Terminal/releases/download/v1.0/Basic.but.sexier.terminal) and open it. Terminal will open on your Mac with the theme active. To set the theme as your default (the one that new Terminal windows open with, go to Terminal preferences, select the Profiles tab, click on the theme "Basic, but sexier" and click the default button at the bottom of the window. All new Terminal windows will use this theme.

### Screenshot

This is what is looks like:

I know, this image doesn't show much. But I was too lazy to actually make a demo to output all of the colours. Leave me alone

### Don't like the name?

Wow, buzzkill. Once installed, go to Terminal preferences, select Profiles, then the theme and press enter on your keyboard. You can enter a new name.

### Known Issues

- Users on macOS 10.12 beta 3 may experience a black border around the Terminal window. There is no known workaround, [file a radar](https://bugreport.apple.com) if you experience this.

Found your own? [Make an issue](https://www.github.com/AppleBetas/Terminal/issues) and tell us what it is. Even better, fork the repo, fix the issue yourself (and export the Terminal profile yourself) and [make a pull request](https://www.github.com/AppleBetas/Terminal/issues).
